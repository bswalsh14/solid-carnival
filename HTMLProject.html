    <h1>HTML Project</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>As I said before, this project is more to organize all my thoughts and ongoing hobbies/spurs of motivation in one place so I can keep track of it all. I took a  class in college on HTML and got the gist of it, but I would defintely like to know how to make things look nicer and create a more interactive website. I understand that requires Java/Javascript so it'll take a while. Mainly using https://www.w3schools.com/html/ to learn more in-depth info on HTML. </p>
    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML Basics </li>
      <p>This includes headings, paragraphs, buttons, links, images and lists. </p>
      <!-- This is a comment, not displayed in the browser :) -->
      <li> CSS </li>
      <p> Understand inline and internal CSS. Not too comfortable with seperate CSS files so definitely need to work on that. </p>
      <li> Tables, Blocks, Lists and sort of Classes </li>
      <p> Tables, blocks and lists aren't too bad, I just think they look clunky. Classes are really neat and I use them and they make sense, but I definitely feel like I could use them more and I worry I'll mix stuff up and break everything so I don't use them as much as I should. </p>
      <li> Layout </li>
      <p> Layout makes sense and I've been able to use it successfully, but just like classes I feel like I could use it more. </p>
      
      </ol>
      <h3>Want to Learn</h3>

    <h1>HTML Project</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>As I said before, this project is more to organize all my thoughts and ongoing hobbies/spurs of motivation in one place so 
      I can keep track of it all. I took a  class in college on HTML and got the gist of it, but I would defintely like to know 
      how to make things look nicer and create a more interactive website. I understand that requires Java/Javascript so it'll 
      take a while. Mainly using https://www.w3schools.com/html/ to learn more in-depth info on HTML. </p>
    
    <h3>Progress</h3>
    <p> Pretty satisfied with the HTML aspect of the website so far. Definitely looking to add more Javascript but thats's a 
      separate topic. Layout is important so I would like a better understanding of that so I could seperate parts of the page. 
      Also need to work on how the layout would affect CSS. I can make it work but I don't really get why it works. </p>
      
    <h3>Want to Learn</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Want to learn how to create a website that can be viewed on an app. Use https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_responsive.asp </li>
      <li> Javascript </li>

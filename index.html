    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Brendan Walsh and this is my personal website where I organize my hobbies and projects and whatnot. I started this website on 2/3/2019 and plan to use it as a life planner for the status on any project I'm doing. I currently work in the finance field and love working with money and taxes, but I need a hobby to do on the side so this is it. </p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The reason I'm creating this website with HTML is that I believe HTML is a very easy computer language to get into and understand. It will also include some Java/Javascript (I don't know the difference) as I use it more and stard understanding it better. I doubt I'll use anything besides those three languages for this website but who knows. </p> 
    <p> The projects page will have all of my projects that I'm currently focused on and the skills page wll be used to gauge how well I understand each skill that I'm working on.
